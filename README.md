# ResNet
In this lab, I analysis diabetic retinopathy (糖尿病所引發視網膜病變) in
the following three steps. 
* First, my own custom DataLoader through PyTorch framework. 
* Second, classify diabetic retinopathy grading via the ResNet architecture(ResNet18 & ResNet50). 
* Finally, calculate the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance.


## resnet18_50.py
It will auto save the __pkl file__ of highest accruary of test data every epoch, and finally save __json file__ of each epoch performance.

Usage:

> python resnet18_50.py

* you can load your pkl file to check the highest accurary of test data, and output a __json file__ for show_result.py to show confusion matrix.

Usage:

> python resnet18_50.py -load /path/to/pkl_file


## show_result.py
1. shows chart of __json file__ generated by resnet18_50.py.

2. use -mat to show confusion matrix result __json file generated by resnet18_50.py load pkl file.__

Usage:

> python show_result.py /path/to/json_file

> python show_result.py /path/to/json_file -mat
